In Git, the commit you are currently on is known as the HEAD commit. In many cases, the most recently made commit is the HEAD commit.
git show HEAD

This command: git checkout HEAD filename

will restore the file in your working directory to look exactly as it did when you last made a commit.

This command: git reset HEAD filename

resets the file in the staging area to be the same as the HEAD commit.
